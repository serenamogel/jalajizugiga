They may be two different expressions of a sci-fi/fantasy epic spectacle with an emphasis on visual effects, but it’s the same coin nevertheless.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>Beyond that, the two franchises also share some creative talent between them, most notably in the form of actress Zoe Saldaña, who portrays alien assassin and former Guardians of the Galaxy member Gamora in the MCU, and Omaticaya clan princess Neytiri in the Avatar films.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>But with the recent release of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Avatar: The Way of Water</strong></a>, we can add another name to the list of actors who boast the thumbs-up from both Kevin Feige and Cameron, and that name is Jack Champion, whose turn as the young Spider in Way of Water was among the most impressive of the whole cast.</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>His debut in the MCU, however, may escape the memory of even the most well-traveled Marvel fan. Champion appeared in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avengers: Endgame</a> as the rather morbid child on the bike who gets stopped by Scott Lang, who had just escaped from the Quantum Realm and was therefore not privy to the Snap or its effects on the universe, which was indicated by Lang’s famous “What the hell happened here” line that the internet would go on to have a field day with.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>It may have been less than a minute of screen time, but it holds many fond memories for Champion, who revealed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that many of those memories involved resident national treasure <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Rudd</a>.</p><p>I mean, it’s an Avengers movie. I was so stoked to be a part of that, and working with Paul Rudd was an absolute honor. He’s one of the nicest guys. He sat next to me the whole day and answered all of my annoying questions and never once got short with me or anything like that.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>He would go on to note that even the smallest amount of screen time means the world when it sticks with a viewer.</p><p>I’m honestly just really grateful and surprised by how many people come up to me to say that they liked my 10 seconds of performance in that movie. When someone says they like your performance in a movie, that really means a lot, even if it was 10 seconds. So it still makes my day every time I hear it.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Having bagged the MCU and Avatar by the age of 12 (Champion, 18, was cast in Way of Water in 2017), the young actor has a claim to one of the biggest Hollywood starts in history, and with Way of Water only being the beginning for Spider, Champion has quite a bit of insurance in the movie star department, too.</p><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Avatar: The Way of Water is currently playing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomK%2BZpJa%2FbsDHnmSwmalivKd51pqrnqpdqMGivoyrnJ%2BklZjBtHnOp2Sbqpmas26t1Z6loJ2iqHqmusOgmKadXZa9sbHAq5inm5Viwamt02ajmq2emLWmsIyaZK2gn6rAorrDZqSepZWofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
