The show was a tremendous hit, and the Olsen twins grew up in front of the American viewing public. When the show was over, the twins built their own business empire in dolls, DVDs, feature film and fashion.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Success</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born June 13, 1986 in Sherman Oaks, California, Ashley is the daughter of mortgage banker David Olsen and manager Jarnie Olsen. Along with her twin sister, Mary-Kate, Ashley has become among the most popular and bankable female personalities in America. The Olsen twins made their acting debut in 1987 at nine months old, sharing the role of the youngest daughter, Michelle Tanner, on the family sitcom Full House. The series ran for eight years, during which the Olsen twins' career took off.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the age of 12, the girls had starred in home videos, feature films, multi-media entertainment and another TV series, Two of a Kind. Under the name Dualstar Entertainment, they produced several straight-to-video movies, a line of musical detective videos entitled The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley, and the enormously successful You're Invited to Mary-Kate and Ashley's party tapes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They also introduced a series of companion books to accompany the videos.

The twins made their big screen debut in 1995 in It Takes Two.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to acting, the Olsens have became a huge force in girl marketing.

They also made their foray into the world of high-end fashion by launching a line of their own called The Row. In 2007, they announced another line of more contemporary clothing, Elizabeth and James, which is named after their sister and brother. They are also known for their more affordable lines StyleMint and Olsenboye.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Two years later, in 2007, Forbes ranked Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen as the 11th-richest women in entertainment, their estimated net worth at nearly $100 million.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2012, the Olsen Twins won the top prize at the CFDA (Council Of Fashion Designers of America) Fashion Awards, and three years later they also won the Womenswear Designer of the Year for The Row.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Currently, the twins are creative directors for the Italian shoe line Superga.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Other Projects</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In October 2008, the twins released the book Influence, a work introducing readers to the artists and designers who have influenced the Olsens over the last decade. Released through a division of the Penguin Young Readers Group, the work features figures such as Christian Louboutin, Lauren Hutton and Bob Colacello. It became an instant best seller, and the twins launched a promotional tour for the book.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2015, Netflix announced a reboot of Full House aptly called Fuller House, but after much speculation, the Olsen twins decided not to participate in the series.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After her split from long-time beau Matt Kaplan, Ashley has been romantically linked to several big names including actor/singer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jared-leto data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jared Leto" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jared Leto</a>, cyclist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/lance-armstrong data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lance Armstrong" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lance Armstrong</a> and actor Justin Bartha.
