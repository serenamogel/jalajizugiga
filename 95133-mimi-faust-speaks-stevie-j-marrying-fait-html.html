In a candid video interview, she congratulated the couple and suggested Faith acquire one thing before signing her marriage contract.</p><p class=Wg>Mimi Faust’s reaction to her ex Stevie J’s wedding to Faith Evans is at first one of disbelief, but she later exclaimed, “better her than me” and even offered Faith a free pair of her new eyewear line.</p><p class=Wg>The 46-year-old ‘Love $ Hip Hop: Atlanta’ star was at Karlie Redd’s listening party, ‘Freddy O’ when she was asked about her thoughts on the record producer’s recent wedding and this is what she had to say.</p><p class=Wg>“Is that real? I don’t know. I saw it on the blogs. I don’t know sh*t. Listen, if it’s real, Congratulations to the both of them. Faith, Stevie. Congratulations Faith. I don’t know what’s going on.”</p><p class=Wg>And while it appeared Mimi was genuinely happy for the couple, she suggested Faith wear a pair of her eyeglasses before signing any contract with the father of her daughter, Eva Giselle.</p><p class=Wg>“I think I need to give you a pair of my glasses because you need to read that contract thoroughly. Born and Fed. Faith, I think you might need to get a pair of glasses to read that marriage certificate or whatever prenup he wants you to—I don’t know what he asked you to sign but read it thoroughly. I don’t know. Congratulations though. Y’all got a whole football team.”</p><p class=Wg>And as a parting shot, Mimi added,</p><p class=Wg>“All that I can say is better her than me. More power to the people and goodnight.”</p><p class=Wg>Stevie and Faith reportedly tied the knot in Las Vegas on July 17. It was a surprise ceremony that took place in the living room of their hotel suite. According to<a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.tmz.com/2018/07/18/faith-evans-stevie-j-apply-for-marriage-license-las-vegas/> TMZ,</a> the couple held hands as the ‘Ave Maria’ played on portable speakers, prompting them to tear up while the song played on.</p><p class=Wg>Following their impromptu wedding, the couple appeared to have confirmed the news when Stevie tweeted, “I love you Faith Renee Jordan,” and his rumored bride responded hours later with “I love you back Steve Aaron Jordan.”</p><p class=Wg>This is actually Stevie’s first marriage despite a string of baby mamas he’s had. The television personality has six children in total with five different women including Mimi and more recently, Joseline Hernandez.
