It was a storyline that commenced in early 2022 and seemingly came to a halt at the Elimination Chamber Premium Live Event last year.</p><p><a href=#>Sami Zayn</a> had been working hard to become part of the Bloodline for a long time. It finally happened in mid-2022. Things seemed to be going very well but Zayn <a href=#>turned on Roman Reigns</a> and his faction at the 2023 Royal Rumble PLE. He attacked The Tribal Chief as he couldn’t stand seeing his best friend Kevin Owens get punished by the Bloodline.</p><p>This then led to the match between Reigns and Zayn at the Elimination Chamber PLE. The event took place in Sami Zayn’s hometown of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was the main event of the night and was for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.</p><p>After a brutal battle, The Head of the Table <a href=#>managed to defeat</a> Zayn thanks to some help from his Bloodline faction.</p><p>As 2023 has come to an end, fans and critics alike are sharing their list of the best wrestling matches in the year. One fan named Zayn vs Reigns as his favorite match with Ilja Dragunov and Dijak’s bout as his second favorite. <a href=#>Dijak</a> replied to the fan agreeing with his picks and gave heaps of praise to both Sami Zayn and Roman Reigns.</p><p>“As much as I love seeing my own work praised, and trust me I do, Roman Reigns vs Sami Zayn was one of the best matches I’ve ever seen and I think people just forget because they wanted a different winner. That match deserves so much more praise,” Dijak tweeted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>As much as I love seeing my own work praised, and trust me I do, Roman Reigns vs Sami Zayn was one of the best matches I’ve ever seen and I think people just forget because they wanted a different winner.
