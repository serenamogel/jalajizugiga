In 1958, Ecclestone participated in two Grand Prix races, but his ambitions on the track faced setbacks as he failed to qualify for either event.

Ecclestone’s considerable wealth is a testament to his extensive involvement and success in the realms of motorsport and business. His financial standing reflects not only his achievements as a former chief executive of the Formula One Group but also his strategic contributions to the commercialization of Formula One racing.</p><p>Ecclestone’s entrepreneurial spirit and innovative approach to the management of Formula One played a pivotal role in transforming the financial landscape of the sport. The groundbreaking sale of television rights in the late 1970s, masterminded by Ecclestone, significantly enhanced the commercial appeal of Formula One, contributing to the sport’s global popularity and financial prosperity.</p><p>Ecclestone’s significant breakthrough came in 1972 when he acquired the Brabham team, marking the beginning of his tenure as a team owner. Over the next 15 years, he steered the Brabham team through the dynamic landscape of Formula One, becoming a prominent figure in the sport. His influence expanded beyond team ownership, as he became an integral part of the Formula One Constructors Association.</p><p>The pinnacle of Ecclestone’s impact on Formula One came from his innovative approach to commercializing the sport. In the late 1970s, he spearheaded the groundbreaking sale of television rights, transforming the financial landscape of Formula One. This move not only secured his position as one of the wealthiest individuals in the United Kingdom but also earned him the moniker ‘F1 Supremo’ in journalism circles.</p><p>Ecclestone’s control over Formula One extended to the administration, setup, and logistics of each Grand Prix, providing him with unparalleled influence. However, his tenure as the chief executive of the Formula One Group concluded in 2017 when he was succeeded by Chase Carey. Despite stepping down from the executive role, Ecclestone continued to contribute as chairman emeritus, offering his insights and expertise to the board.</p><p>Beyond his involvement in motorsport, Ecclestone, in partnership with Flavio Briatore, delved into football ownership, taking charge of the English football club Queens Park Rangers from 2007 to 2011. Throughout his career, Ecclestone found himself embroiled in various controversies, including rumors linking him to the infamous Great Train Robbery in 1963. He vehemently denied these rumors in a 2014 interview, attributing them to his association with the getaway driver, Roy James.</p><p>In 1997, Bernie Ecclestone faced a political controversy related to the British Labour Party’s stance on tobacco sponsorship. The Labour Party, having pledged to ban tobacco advertising, presented challenges to Ecclestone’s interests, given the prevalence of tobacco branding in Formula One at the time.</p><p>In recent years, Bernie Ecclestone found himself at the center of attention for controversial statements regarding Vladimir Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Subsequently, he faced legal troubles, officially charged with tax fraud in 2022.
