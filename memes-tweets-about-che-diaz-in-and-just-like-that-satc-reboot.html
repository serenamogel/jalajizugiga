If those words alone send a chill down your spine, you may be entitled to financial compensation. (Or, at least, a good meme or two for your troubles.) Played by Sara Ramirez on <a href=# class=T3D>And Just Like That...,</a> Carrie Bradshaw’s podcast boss has a few bad habits, like <a href=# class=T3D>smoking weed</a> in the worst possible places and having kitchen sex at their <a href=# class=T3D>convalescent employee’s apartment.</a> To which, by the way, they weren’t even invited.</p><p>But for all their faults, Che is a paradoxically bright spot of the <a href=# class=T3D>Sex and the City reboot</a>. They might be entirely too bold — <a href=# class=T3D>as Ramirez told Bustle</a> in December, “This person's way more confident than I am” — but their character also has a sort of unifying effect. Even when the show gets <a href=# class=T3D>fairly glum and tense</a> (as is bound to happen in any reboot that starts with a key character’s <a href=# class=T3D>heart attack</a>), viewers can take solace in memes that are enthralled with and terrified by Che’s inadvertent jump scares and catchphrase of a greeting.</p><p>If you ever want to lighten the mood with something even funnier than Che’s comedy “concert,” these memes and tweets should have you covered.</p><h2>Hey, It’s Che Diaz!</h2><p>Naturally, many Che Diaz tweets revolved around their signature greeting — and the visceral fear of them showing up unannounced, which writer Carey O’Donnell spoofed in one hilarious video.</p><h2>The Risky Hookup</h2><p>Warmest congratulations to Miranda for having the best sex of her life! Now, if only it weren’t so ill-timed (and ill-placed). While several users poked fun at the awkward hookup situation in Episode 5, writer Sophie Ross predicted Che could be moving onto <a href=# class=T3D>another New Yorker</a> very soon.</p><h2>Love For Che</h2><p>Hey, Che still has plenty of fans out there, including Selling Sunset’s <a href=# class=T3D>Chrishell Stause,</a> who found the podcaster “funny and charming” before looking into the discourse (rookie mistake). Others simply acknowledged that, yeah, Che Diaz makes Twitter better.</p><p>Until that Che Diaz spinoff is announced (one can dream!), here’s to many more meme-worthy moments in the remainder of And Just Like That...</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqadnZrAbsDWnpytq12Wr7DB02aaoZ1dmbaixoyipWaZnpl6q8HSrWSloZuaerW0wK1krJmkmHqzscGopq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
