So it’s not only disturbing to see these images but it’s disturbing in terms of what it means for the case.”</p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=826 data-injectable=true>Unsure of the source of the leak, Cain and Greenlee contacted both Mr. Allen’s lawyers and the Indiana police about the photos. They eventually learned that someone with associations both to Mr. Baldwin and to Mr. Rozzi had shared them with their source. This individual was reportedly a friend of Mr Baldwin’s, and had worked at his law firm once, but had never been involved in the Delphi case, and had left many years ago. The man reportedly took his own life after law enforcement started looking into the leak.</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>At the hearing, the judge granted a one-year extension of the trial for the high-profile case involving the murder of teenagers Libby German and Abby Williams. As it stands, the girls’ families will have had to wait for over seven years before they can get justice in this matter. Originally set for Jan. 24, 2024, the trial has been delayed until Oct. 15 due to Mr. Allen’s attorneys claiming they would not be able to adequately prepare with only three months to go through all the evidence.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>The trial has now been pushed back to Oct. 15, 2024, after Mr. Allen’s new attorneys raised concerns that they would not be able to get up to speed with the wealth of evidence in just three months’ time.</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>They were only appointed by the court on Oct. 27, after the prior legal team quit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1unnDoptmqpmYtaK%2Bw2aYpaSVo8BurdOtpqumla56uLXToZurmadis7O7zGaroZ1dmbKtvMeiZKatopmys3nCmqqeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
