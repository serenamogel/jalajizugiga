She signed with the Black River Entertainment label at age 19 and achieved immediate success with her debut album, The First Time, from 2015. Her songs often contain personal lyrics and a mix of country and pop influences. Ballerini has announced she will release her seventh album later in 2024.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-1gabq6d emt9r7s1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-tip css-iim6mq emevuu60">FULL NAME: Kelsea Nicole Ballerini<br>BORN: September 12, 1993<br>BIRTHPLACE: Mascot, Tennessee<br>SPOUSE: Morgan Evans (2017-2022)<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Virgo</p><h2 data-node-id title="Where Is Kelsea Ballerini From?" data-anchor-id=where-is-kelsea-ballerini-from class="body-h2 css-1gabq6d emt9r7s1">Where Is Kelsea Ballerini From?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kelsea Nicole Ballerini was born on September 12, 1993, in Mascot, Tennessee, and raised in nearby Knoxville. She is the only child of Ed Ballerini, who worked as a sales manager for a radio station in the city, and Carla Denham, a marketing professional in the publishing industry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/country/kelsea-ballerini-taylor-swift-nashville-women-in-country-airplay-interview-6634533/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ballerini described her childhood" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Ballerini described her childhood</a> as “very Southern,” complete with “church on Sunday, a big family, [and] fried chicken.” She and her parents shared a rural plot of land with other family members, as well as three cows and a goat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ballerini showed an interest in the arts from a young age. She took dance lessons for 10 years, earning the alliterative nickname “Ballerini the Ballerina,” and competed for a local hip-hop dance team. She also participated in her church’s choir and glee club. Kelsea wrote her first song as a gift to her mom, Carla, after forgetting to get her a present for Mother’s Day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At age 12, Ballerini grappled with her parents’ divorce. She began suffering from bulimia around this time, also taking diet pills and working out excessively. She eventually sought help for her eating disorder at age 18 after passing out several times. “I think, for me, it was a source of control,” she said in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/country/kelsea-ballerini-reveals-past-struggle-with-eating-disorder/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a 2021 interview with People" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">a 2021 interview with People</a>. “There are still days where I revert back to being that 12-year-old, and I have to catch myself and hold myself accountable to the work I’ve done.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the meantime, Ballerini had her first meeting with a Nashville record label at age 14, though she was rejected and bluntly told she sounded too similar to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/taylor-swift data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Taylor Swift" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Taylor Swift</a>. She and her mother moved to the city soon after. Kelsea graduated from Centennial High School in the suburb of Franklin, Tennessee, and attended Lipscomb University starting in 2011.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Women in Country Music</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id title="Music Career" data-anchor-id=music-career class="body-h2 css-1gabq6d emt9r7s1">Music Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although she grew up in the epicenter of country music, Ballerini initially found inspiration in primarily pop artists. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/britney-spears data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Britney Spears" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Britney Spears</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/a45193915/nsync-members-then-and-now data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=*NSYNC class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">*NSYNC</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/shania-twain data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shania Twain" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Shania Twain</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/kelly-clarkson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kelly Clarkson" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Kelly Clarkson</a> were among her early idols. She has called Clarkson her favorite artist of all time: “I think that she’s the best vocalist in the whole world, but my favorite is watching her interviews because she’s so 200 percent herself,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/kelsea-ballerini-touring-with-rascal-flatts-collaborating-nick-jonas-7357904/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she told Billboard" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">she told Billboard</a> in 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hoping to make it big like Clarkson, Ballerini continued to pursue music while at Lipscomb University, which is located in Nashville, and performed in variety shows. She reached an agreement with her mother that she would drop out of college if she caught her big break in music. That finally came in 2013, when Black River Entertainment signed the 19-year-old and added her to its artist roster. Next came making her breakout first album.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-77asv7 emevuu60">Early Albums: The First Time and Unapologetically</h2><img alt="kelsea ballerini plays guitar and smiles at the camera while on a stage, she wears a tan hat and black dress, a microphone on a stand is on the left" title="Kelsea Ballerini in concert, April 2015" width=3880 height=2520 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kelsea-ballerini-performs-onstage-during-the-acm-party-for-news-photo-1718983770.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Kelsea Ballerini performs in April 2015, one month before releasing her first album.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ballerini showed she would be a force from the start with her debut studio record The First Time, released in May 2015. She became the first female country artist to have her first three singles—“Love Me Like You Mean It,” “Dibs,” and “Peter Pan”—from an introductory album all reach No. 1 on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart. “Peter Pan” is also her only song to date to reach No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Off the now-platinum-certified album’s success, Ballerini was named New Female Vocalist of the Year at the 2016 ACM Awards.

She also released an accompanying album Ballerini, featuring alternate versions of songs from Kelsea, later that year. In 2021, Ballerini, a self-professed Jonas Brothers fan, fulfilled a personal dream by performing as an opener on the group’s Remember This Tour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In September 2022, she released the album Subject to Change, spawning the popular single “If You Go Down (I’m Goin’ Down Too).” The song about a close-knit female friendship was inspired by the 1991 Geena Davis and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/susan-sarandon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Susan Sarandon" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Susan Sarandon</a> movie Thelma & Louise, as well as the singer’s relationship with her own pals amid her divorce from her ex-husband, Morgan Evans. “Sometimes, you put out a single because you think it’s the most radio-friendly, and sometimes you put out a single because it’s actually reflective of where you’re at in your life. And then sometimes, both things can be true,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/country/kelsea-ballerini-if-you-go-down-makin-tracks-1235178080/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she told Billboard" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">she told Billboard</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her breakup with Evans also served as the primary influence for her February 2023 EP Rolling Up the Welcome Mat, which became Ballerini’s sixth album to reach the Top 20 on the Top Country Albums chart. Led by the single “Blindsided,” the project was nominated for Album of the Year at the CMA Awards and ACM Awards in 2023 and earned Ballerini her fourth Grammy nomination, for Best Country Album, the following year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ballerini has stayed busy outside the studio, as well. She embarked on her multi-leg Heartfirst Tour in 2022 and sold out her first headlining major arena show in Knoxville the following year. She also joined Chesney for his I Go Back 2023 Tour.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Emerging Country Talent</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h3 css-77asv7 emevuu60">New Album</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The singer has teased a new album due out later this year. “It’ll be worth the wait.

(Her biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100 is “Peter Pan,” which peaked at No. 35.) Peaking in June 2015, “Love Me Like You Mean It” was the first of her seven singles that have become Top 10 Hot Country Songs.
