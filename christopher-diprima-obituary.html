The school “grieves the loss of” 10th grader DiPrima. It added that in light of what happened, counselors would be available for students who need them at all Excel campuses.</p><p>The post stated that Christopher was a kind and jolly person who brought joy to the people around him. He will be dearly missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Steven Gingras, DiPrima’s cousin, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WMUR</a> that DiPrima was a great big brother to his 12-year-old sister Gisel who always included her and treated her with incredible love and kindness.</p><p>“A kid who was nice, polite, smart, had his whole future ahead of him, but was very humble, very kind,” said Gingras while remembering the deceased.&nbsp;</p><p>DiPrima’s family was skiing on Duster Ski Trail at Pats Peak in Henniker, New Hampshire, at about 6:35 p.m. Saturday when the accident occurred.</p><p>Duster Ski Trail belongs to the category of intermediate-level skiing. DiPrima was brought to the base of the mountain by the ski patrol and later transferred to the Concord Hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>Gingras stated that this was not his deceased’s cousin’s first time skiing, and he had been going on skiing trips for a few years. Unfortunately, this time, he slipped, hit a bump, went flying, and landed a few meters down the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>The cause of the accident is under investigation. The authorities are taking this accident very seriously, as the loss of such a young life is devastating for the family of the victim.</p><p>The authorities, as well as the administration at Pats Peak, are working to ensure that accidents of such nature and impact do not occur in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>According to its website, the independent, family-owned Pats Peak originally opened in 1963. The ski area offers 11 lifts and 28 trails, with a base elevation of 690 feet and a summit elevation of 1,460 feet.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvx6ugrKyfpbWmvoydoKmqmaKubrvBoquumaKufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
