Now, Coco Gauff is rocking a title belt thanks to her US Open win.</p><p>Coco Gauff won the US Open title on September 9th. The final match saw Gauff face off against Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set match to claim her first major tennis championship. On social media, she proudly displayed her US Open trophy alongside a WWE Championship belt, a tradition where WWE often sends custom championship belts to notable sports champions.</p><p>Coco Gauff dropped a photo with a caption that said “[trophy emoji] with the belt goes hard.” Many fans had to agree as they chimed in with a positive reaction.</p><p>The WWE Championship Coco posed with is an authentic replica. The company seemingly sent her the gold after that big win.</p><p>This<a href=#> practice of celebrating athletic victories </a>with WWE Championship belts extends to other sports, as members of the Denver Nuggets and Kansas City Chiefs also celebrated their NBA Finals and Super Bowl wins with WWE Championship belts. Many more teams and athletes have done the same as they celebrate as champions.</p><p>WWE also retweeted Coco Gauff after her big win. This was obviously great PR for them, as they got their branding around the shoulder of another athletic champion. Only time will tell who will get their own WWE Title belt next.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Keep checking back with us here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a> for more on this story, and many more in the pro wrestling world.
