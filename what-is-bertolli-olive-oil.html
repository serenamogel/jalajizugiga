Industry standards for the extra-virgin grade require 100% purity; EVOO is unadulterated oil from olives using no chemicals or heat to extract oil from the fruit purity and a free fatty acid content no greater than 0.08%.<h2>How can you tell real olive oil?</h2>Look at the label to find out exactly where the olive oil was produced. In addition, the label should say “extra virgin,” and avoid any terms like “pure,” “light,” or “olive pomace oil”—that means it's been chemically refined.<h2>Does Bertolli olive oil have polyphenols?</h2>In fact, many of the orchards Bertolli works with have trees that are over 100 years old!

The growing, harvesting, manufacturing and packaging has been reviewed by an accredited organic certifying agency, and they document that every step in the process has been up to par.<h2>Why you shouldn't cook with olive oil?</h2>Olive oil has a lower smoke point-the point at which an oil literally begins to smoke (olive oil's is between 365° and 420°F)-than some other oils. When you heat olive oil to its smoke point, the beneficial compounds in oil start to degrade, and potentially health-harming compounds form.<h2>What is the difference between olive oil and extra virgin olive oil?</h2>Extra-virgin olive oil is made from pure, cold-pressed olives, whereas regular olive oil is a blend, including both cold-pressed and processed oils.
