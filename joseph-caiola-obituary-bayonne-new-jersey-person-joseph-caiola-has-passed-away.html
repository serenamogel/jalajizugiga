In the following Guest Book, Legacy would like to extend an invitation to you to share your memories of Joseph and to express your condolences for his passing. On October 2, 2006, Joseph M. Caiola, a retired printer at Boise Cascade, passed away at Maefair Health Care Centre. He had been a member of the Maefair Health Care Centre for many years.</p><p>Trumbull was his home, and he was 81 years old at the time. He was born in Bridgeport on March 4, 1925, and his parents, Michael Caiola and Fortuna Caliano Caiola, both passed away before he was born. He was the son of both of his parents. In addition, he was a member of the VFW Post in Trumbull and volunteered his time at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centre in West Haven. He also offered his services to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. During World War II, he was a member of the forces of the United States Army.</p><p>In addition to being a loyal fan of the Boston Red Sox, Joe discovered that helping individuals who were in need at the Maefair Health Care Centre in Trumbull brought him a great deal of happiness. His sister, Sue Sherwood, as well as both of his brothers, Anthony Caiola and John Caiola, had already passed away prior to his passing. He was preceded in death by his wife, Dolores Caiola, who also passed away.</p><p>Some of the people who survived include a daughter named Joelle Classey who lives in Westerly, Rhode Island; four sons named Joseph Caiola, Jr. of Trumbull, John Caiola of Fairfield, Paul Caiola of Monroe, and Randall Caiola of Trumbull; a brother named Sam Caiola of Bridgeport; three sisters named Louise Gulas of Newtown, Lucy Yanosy of Bridgeport, and Mary Tompkins of Hamden; thirteen grandchildren, a great grandchild, and a sizeable number of nieces and nephews are also among the survivors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwts6snKmgXZiuqrvLmmSompmpwqK%2B2GaZmrGfo7umec2ermailafApsWMqZyrq5%2Bjequ70p6noWWTlrawuMBmn5qrXaWutL%2FEnWSar5GufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
