And then there are nights when I just crave something simple. This is the latter, obviously, and it’ll take you only ten minutes to make. The ingredient combo here is a little strange, but hear me out – soba noodles, sesame oil&nbsp;and good parmesan cheese all have a delicious nutty flavor in common. Basil and fresh peas are sweet&nbsp;which offer a nice simple balance. I love the subtle flavor of fresh peas here, if you don’t have any, just skip them…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>As I’m putting the finishing touches on our book, (T minus 3 days!) I thought now would be a good&nbsp;time to start making&nbsp;recipes from other peoples’ books… Last week, I briefly talked about Anna’s book, A Modern Way To Eat.&nbsp;While it’s been out for awhile now, it’s&nbsp;only recently&nbsp;been released in the US and I finally got my hands on a copy. What I love about it is that it’s more than just a book full of recipes (although there are over 200 of them!)… she offers&nbsp;tons of delicious ideas for how to mix&nbsp;flavors and textures together in creative&nbsp;but not-fussy ways.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Jack here, writing for the blog today while Jeanine writes for the book… I have something to admit that I’m having a hard time with. I’m starting to prefer vegan “mac and cheese”&nbsp;to actual mac and cheese. Now, this is a hard one for me. You see, I love cheese. Almost every time we go to Whole Foods, I raid the “under $3 cheese” bin to find crazy new cheeses that I can barely pronounce. And a great grilled cheese is work of art. But these vegan “mac and cheese” recipes Jeanine comes up with pretty much hit everything I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’ll cut to the chase and just start with&nbsp;“exciting news” part – we’re writing a cookbook! I haven’t been overly secretive about it, but it’s official… 288 pages of never-been-blogged-before vegetable-ey goodness will be out next April! (I know, I know, a whole year away – I promise it’ll be worth the wait). It’s being published by Penguin US and Penguin Canada, the teams behind some of my favorite books including&nbsp;Oh She Glows and What Katie Ate. We’ve been hard at work for months now and I can’t wait&nbsp;to show you how it’s coming together!&nbsp;I’ll be sharing updates and previews…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It doesn’t get much easier than this one. I’ll admit, I often get very veggie-happy. While I don’t mind chopping up a rainbow of vegetables – sometimes it’s more than ok to keep it simple and let just one ingredient be the star. Last night, I chopped up this beautiful red chard and tossed it with a few simple pantry ingredients. Dinner&nbsp;was done in less than 20 minutes, and Jack and&nbsp;I were able to get right&nbsp;back to our&nbsp;House of Cards marathon.&nbsp;(Don’t tell me what happens, we’re only a few episodes in). Chard works especially well in a 1-vegetable meal because…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Jack and I have a Valentines Day ritual that involves never going to a restaurant. We love to stay home, pop open some good wine&nbsp;and&nbsp;tackle a special&nbsp;kitchen project – the messier the better. Check out our pasta-date story (and recipe!) on CamilleStyles.com. (And special thanks to Kate LeSueur for being the 3rd wheel on our little date while capturing these gorgeous photos!)</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>As a kid, I was obsessed with&nbsp;everything rainbow – my Rainbow Brite doll, a fresh&nbsp;new&nbsp;Crayola 64 pack (with built in sharpener!), and best of all&nbsp;– the rainbow-neon terminal at O’Hare airport. Pure magic. Nowadays, I have a new grownup rainbow obsession: rainbow chard. Cooking with Rainbow Chard If you’ve never cooked with rainbow chard before, it has a slightly bitter, earthy taste that I love to pair with sweet, tangy, and nutty accents. Aside from its gorgeous vibrant color, it has a special superpower: it’s kind of two vegetables in one! Not only can you use the chard leaves, but…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Hi everyone, Jack here reporting in from the frozen tundra&nbsp;of Chicago. We flew in for a quick weekend over Jeanine’s birthday (happy birthday!!!) and it is just beyond cold. Austin’s apparently snowing today, but still, not much prepares you for walking outside into 9ºF (-13ºC) weather from a nice, warm airport. This&nbsp;blog is almost always about making meals completely from scratch, but it’s cold times like this that sometimes you just want to pour a box of mac&nbsp;and cheese into a pot&nbsp;and go to town. Well we did that, posted a photo here on Instagram, and people went crazy for…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Butternut squash soup may be my favorite fall comfort food, but this butternut squash pasta is now a close second. It’s a pretty easy throw-together pasta&nbsp;made from a classic fall flavor combo:&nbsp;butternut squash, sage, and walnuts. The sweet, caramelized squash plays perfectly off the earthy sage and nutty walnuts, and a little butter and pecorino add the perfect amount of richness. This is one we’ll have on repeat all season long. To make it, simply roast the squash until it’s tender and caramelized. Then, sauté the shallot, sage, walnuts, chickpeas, cooked butternut squash, and garlic until the chickpeas and squash…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>You still have tons of zucchini right? Ok, I thought so, just checking. This summer squash pasta recipe should be next on your to-make list. It’s a straight-forward, simple&nbsp;dish – perfect for&nbsp;highlighting a special seasonal ingredient like summer squash. My zucchini and yellow summer squash were on the small side,&nbsp;so I sliced them into thin little coins and paired them with&nbsp;orecchiette pasta. I like how the shape of the summer squash and the shape of the pasta are somewhat similar. It makes for a nice “easy-to-get-it-all-on-your-fork” sort of texture.

When I dug through her fridge, I found crunchy veggies, summer herbs, and a big, juicy mango that I absolutely had to use. I caught sight of a box of orzo pasta and a can of chickpeas in her pantry, and I immediately thought – orzo salad! It would be hearty enough to serve for dinner, but light and refreshing for the heat wave that was happening that night. I tossed together crunchy cucumbers, red onion, fresh herbs, and mango and dished it up for my family.
