It’s certainly taken long enough but it’s exciting to see a rare, R-rated comedy with a woman at the helm and a strong, female cast. <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a>, <a href=#>Jillian Bell</a>, <a href=#>Ilana Glazer</a>, <a href=#>Zoe Kravitz</a> and <a href=#>Kate McKinnon</a> are down for whatever and they bring an appealing, eclectic mix of energy to the screen. If only they had more to do than flail from one wacky scenario to the next.</p><p>The script from Aniello and <a href=#>Paul W. Downs</a>—her longtime creative and romantic partner, who also has a supporting role as Johansson’s fiancé—feels like it’s composed of bits of other raucous films from “<a href=#>The Hangover</a>” to “Weekend at Bernie’s,” even as it aims to be more than just a female version of a specific type of male-centric comedy. In between the wild set pieces, the pacing drags as the ladies struggle to rekindle their lost friendship.</p><p>“Rough Night” starts strong, though, in 2006 with a glimpse of the crazy, booze-infused connection that bound these women in college. A decade later, Johansson’s Jess is running for state senate and is about to get married to the kind and patient Peter (Downs). The party has been over for a while, it seems, as evidenced by her conservative clothes and awful ad campaign. Johansson is so naturally engaging, though, she finds a way to bring her smarts and timing to an unusually ordinary role.</p><p>But Jess’ best friend, Alice (Bell), insists on reliving their glory days with a bachelorette party for the ages. She gathers up their former freshman dorm mates Frankie (“Broad City” star Glazer) and Blair (Kravitz) and they all descend on Miami for a weekend of debauchery, complete with a wide variety of penis-shaped gag gifts. (If there’s one thing “Rough Night” gets right, it’s the uncomfortable, forced fun that exists within the contrived bachelorette-party setting.)</p><p>But Jess also invites along a close friend from her summer abroad in Australia: McKinnon’s Pippa, whom the jealous Alice insists on calling Kiwi. While fellow comedians Bell and Glazer have made their names going to strange and inspired places, McKinnon is—as always—the irresistible scene-stealer of the bunch, with her intentionally terrible Aussie accent and a fearless physicality.</p><p>And yet, all these talented actresses can only do so much with what’s on the page. Pippa is the New Agey flake. Jess is the responsible leader. Alice is the needy attention seeker. Glazer and Kravitz are afforded even less characterization: Frankie is a tough-talking activist and Blair is … wealthy? High maintenance? We’re told that a tension simmers between the two because they’re estranged lovers, but we never really feel it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46rpq6fmGK7qrPHrWRraGFs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
