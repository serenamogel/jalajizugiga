Each of Sex Education‘s seasons boasts a high rating over on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, where audiences praise the series for its “bawdy,” “heartfelt,” and “honest” delivery. The story is headed out with a bang with its final season, which is largely seen as a satisfying and fulfilling conclusion to the teen dramedy. Nostalgic fans can always r<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eturn to the show’s earlier seasons</a> for a re-binging of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all its best moments</a>, or they can buy up a ticket or two and visit the real-life locations where the series was filmed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sex-education-s-filming-locations data-injectable=false>Sex Education‘s filming locations</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>The plot in Sex Education largely takes place in the fictional town of Moordale, which is vaguely located somewhere in the U.K. In order to maintain realism, much of the filming for Sex Education was fittingly situated in Whales and England.</p><p data-characters=637 data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true>U.K. viewers and frequent visitors to places like Redbrook, Monmouth, and Tinturn will recognize the gorgeous scenery and eye-catching homes scattered across the countryside of England and Whales, but those charming homes are likely unfamiliar to most state-side viewers. A trip to the Wye Valley will reveal many of those <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">familiar Sex Education sights</a>, as will a perusal of Newport. Much of the filming at or around the school took place in the charming Whales borough, with school scenes courtesy of the University of South Wales&nbsp;in&nbsp;Caerleon and swimming pool scenes filmed nearby at the Newport International Sports Village.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sex-education-season-4-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sex-education-season-4-1.jpg><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>In series 2, several of those gorgeous outdoor moments feature scenery from the Forest of Dean in England, and series 3 shifted things southward to largely situate itself in Kent.
