Here are ten movies that show the magnificent event in all its glory.</p><h2 id=h-10-the-seventh-sign data-injectable=false>10. The Seventh Sign</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>This largely forgotten 1988 horror flick is only notable for being an early starring role for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Demi Moore</a>, with Michael Biehn as support. In a world in which signs of the impending Apocalypse are all around, Moore and Biehn are stunned to find a solar eclipse presaging the sixth sign of imminent doom – a catastrophic earthquake.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Little Shop of Horrors</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Frank Oz’ 1986 horror comedy has maintained a strong cade of fans over the years.

Barabbas</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>Alongside Ben-Hur and Spartacus, 1961’s Barabbas was one of a handful of sword-and-sandals epics that wowed audiences in the 1950s and early 1960s. Starring two-time Academy Award winner Anthony Quinn in the lead role, and Hollywood luminaries such as Ernest Borgnine and Jack Palance in support, the film is today chiefly famous for the remarkable crucifixion scene – filming was timed to exactly coincide with an actual solar eclipse.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Dolores Claiborne</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>This 1995 adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name sees Academy Award winner Kathy Bates turn in a mesmerizing performance as Claiborne, who is trapped in a violent relationship.

The film revolves around a family’s move to a house in rural Spain in which children are sacrificed once every forty years during an eclipse – and the new owners’ realization that the last sacrifice ended one child short.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Dragonslayer</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>This 1981 example of sword-and-sorcery romp boasted some big names, including Ralph Richardson, and a pre-Star Wars Ian McDiarmid, and represented the big-screen debut of Peter MacNicol, later to become famous for his work in comedies such as Ghostbusters II and Bean. His character’s hero’s journey comes to an end with a showdown with the dragon against the backdrop of a solar eclipse.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4.

The film tells the story of the inhabitants of a small town in the hours before a solar eclipse. When the eclipse begins, a series of revelations regarding life and love hit the main characters during the darkness. The film also stars The Simpsons cast member Julie Kavner and was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1999.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. 2001: A Space Odyssey</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 masterpiece contains a solar eclipse, though not from a perspective that most of us would recognize. The science fiction epic begins with a shot of the Moon, with Earth and then the Sun emerging beyond it, all set to Richard Strauss’ Also Sprach Zarathrustra. The result was one of film’s truly unforgettable opening sequences. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Ladyhawke</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>It’s more magical shenanigans in this 1985 cult favorite, which stars Matthew Broderick in only his second film appearance after his breakthrough role in 1983’s WarGames, Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Alfred Molina. The eclipse comes late in the movie’s final act and is interpreted by Navarre (Hauer) as a sign of divine intervention.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. Apocalypto</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=false>Mel Gibson’s 2006 survival film about the trials of a Mesoamerican hunter attempting to escape the clutches of his tormentors certainly has its fair share of detractors and has come in for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sustained criticism</a> for its religious subtexts. However, there’s no denying its epic feel, and nowhere is this more obvious than in the extraordinary scene in which the sacrifice of the hero is interrupted by an eclipse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoaGllnaTDqrHSZp2emaSqv6q6xmaknqudmr%2Bqxsinnmarn6Gus3nEnKOiqKOawHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
