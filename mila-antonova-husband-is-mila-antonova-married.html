Some debate arose regarding her age, as she discussed the topic of age in relation to playing bridge.</p><p>During a public speaking engagement in 2010, Antonova posed the question, “Do I look like an old person to you?” She emphasized that one doesn’t need to be old to play bridge and highlighted the increasing involvement of young people in the card game.</p><p>The initial meeting between Antonova and Gates took place in the summer of 2009 at the North American Bridge Championships (NABC) held in Washington DC.</p><p>Antonova had immigrated to New York City from Russia around 2006 after completing her studies there. Considering that students typically finish high school at around 18 years old, it can be inferred that Antonova may have been approximately 21 in 2009.</p><p>It is believed that a college professor introduced Antonova to the game of bridge. In Russia, earning a Bachelor’s diploma typically takes four years. Taking this into account, Antonova could have been around 22 years old when she moved to the United States. Consequently, she would have been approximately 25 at the time of her encounter with Gates.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal article mentioned that Antonova later relocated to California on the West Coast and pursued a career as a software engineer in recent years.</p><p>In the past decade, Miss Antonova has maintained a relatively low profile, distancing herself from the media spotlight, especially in light of the allegations surrounding her alleged affair with Gates.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mila Antonova Husband: Is Mila Antonova Married?</h2><p>There are no details about the husband of Mila Antonova.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqagpZldlru1u82orZplmKrAo63NnWSiq12itq2tjJqlraeepMOiecyaqauhlZl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
