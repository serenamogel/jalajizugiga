And while the production house has notably focused on horror projects in the past, its latest venture shifts focus towards a touching story about the lives of a mother and son duo. We’re talking about Jesse Eisenberg’s<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">When You Finish Saving the World</a></strong>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after the official trailer dropped yesterday</a>, moviegoers from all walks of life have been offering up their two cents on the potential for the upcoming movie.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>One of the main attractions in the heartwarming film is Stranger Things star <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Finn Wolfhard</a></strong>, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fully engaged fans</a> with his incomparable acting prowess and artistic abilities. The latter of Wolfhard’s abilities is showcased in the movie, with Wolfhard’s character Ziggy Katz being a young musician who live streams his talent to the world. Katz is presented in the movie as a singer who also plays the guitar, prompting a plethora of film fanatics to wonder if Wolfhard is actually tugging the strings.</p><h2 id=h-is-finn-wolfhard-really-playing-guitar-in-the-movie data-injectable=false>Is Finn Wolfhard really playing guitar in the movie?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Finn-Wolfhard-When-You-Finish-Saving-The-World.jpg><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>At the age of 11-years-old, Wolfhard first learned how to play the guitar, which eventually led the now-19-year-old superstar to forming his own rock band, Calpurnia, for which he is both the lead vocalist and guitarist. In addition, Wolfhard is also a member of another band known as The Aubreys.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>With that being said, the simple answer to the question above is: <strong>yes</strong>. There’s certainly no doubt that Wolfhard himself is playing the guitar during the live-stream scenes in the movie, in which he stars as the teenage son of Julianne Moore’s character Rachel. Seeing as both Wolfhard and his guitar are hungry musicians who share a love for music, it makes perfect sense as to why director Jesse Eisenberg would cast him in the role.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Along with his insane guitar shredding, Jesse Eisenberg subsequently revealed that Wolfhard <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was a helpful collaborator in writing the lyrics</a> for the songs that his character Ziggy sings in the movie. At this point, with his unmatched talent spreading across film, music, and songwriting, it would probably be easier to ask what Finn Wolfhard CAN’T do?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxllp67r3nWqKOfoJGnsW6%2BxJqjpbFdpbmixcinnmafpZ7Bor6MoqVmr5iau27Fzq5kn6GensCpedKaraKml2LBqbGMsKarpJRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
