This Halloween, Trader Joe’s, king of all things fall, decided to dress up like Snickers, Twix, Milky Way, and Three Musketeers. That is to say, this year Trader Joe’s will have a Halloween chocolate candy assortment consisting of some ~suspiciously familiar~ sweet treats.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-these-treats-will-they-be-better-than-the-name-brand-chocolate-variety-packs-i-always-buy-at-walmart-exactly-one-day-before-halloween>What are these treats? Will they be better than the name-brand chocolate variety packs I always buy at Walmart exactly one day before Halloween?</h2><p>Let’s go one question at a time. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trader Joe’s Treasure Hunt</a> on Instagram, the variety pack will be called Trader Joe’s Wicked Good Mini Chocolate Bars (how Ben Affleck of them), and will feature 24 miniature chocolates of four varieties: Nougat & Caramel, Peanut & Caramel, Caramel & Wafer, and Nougat. So if you are keeping score, that seems like we are in for dupes of Milky Way, Snickers, Twix, and Three Musketeers, respectively. And by the looks of the chocolates on the packaging and the lack of specification anywhere, I would bet that these bad boys will be rockin’ a milk chocolate coating just like their mainstream counterparts.</p><p><strong>Read Sporked’s ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Halloween candy</a></strong></p><p>It is impossible to tell from the packaging if these will be individually wrapped inside the larger bag but one can only assume that they are since they’re clearly meant to be a Halloween offering and having them loose in a bag would kind of defeat the purpose. That being said, we don’t know yet what that inner packaging will look like—it could be anything from clear plastic to a design that echoes the bag the bars come in. Will they be better than name brand minis? We can’t really know until we try them! But Trader Joe’s usually does pretty well in the candy department, so I have high hopes for these. As for when they are available in stores, it is hard to know with Trader Joe’s since every store is slightly different, but it seems as though these are out in some places and not yet on shelves in others. So, if you are interested, check out your local TJ’s and if they aren’t carrying them there yet don’t worry, I’m sure some Wicked Good Mini Chocolates your way comes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKyilrGmvoyjpp6rXZ2urbjOsJyepl2Yrq%2Bw2Galnq%2BjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
