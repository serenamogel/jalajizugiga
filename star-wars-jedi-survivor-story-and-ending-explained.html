The long-awaited sequel to 2019’s impressive Fallen Order picks up five years after the original game ended, delivering a bombastic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new Star Wars adventure</a> heavily steeped in lore from movies, TV shows, books, and comics.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>The story has some unexpected twists and turns, delivering on the promise of showing Cal Kestis as a fully-fledged Jedi Knight battling the Empire nine years before the events of A New Hope.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>If you’re here you probably want to know how this story goes down but, for one final time, we’ll warn you that the following is a complete rundown of the game’s story, who appears in it, and where this story may go next.</p><h2 id=h-opening-chapters data-injectable=false>Opening chapters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor_20230419123603.jpg><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The game begins</a> in Coruscant, where it appears Cal has been captured by Imperial Senator Sejan. He’s pleased to have a prize to deliver to the Emperor, but the tables are almost instantly turned when Cal breaks free and his captors are revealed to be his comrades in disguise.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>Cal and his new buddy, hunky jet-pack warrior Bode, set out to secure his ship. Soon the senator is himself captured, with Cal using a Jedi mind trick to retrieve some key information on Imperial positions for Saw Gerrara.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Very quickly it all goes south. The Ninth Sister Inquisitor arrives with a fleet of attack craft, killing off practically everyone in Cal’s team except Bode. After defeating the Ninth Sister Cal flees Coruscant, though his ship the Mantis is damaged in the process. Repairs are needed, and who better to reach out to than four-armed Fallen Order pilot Greez?</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>Greez is running a saloon on the planet Koboh, and on a trip into caverns below the bar’s basement Cal discovers an ancient droid named Zee. She hails from the High Republic era seen in books and comics (roughly 200 years before The Phantom Menace), was formerly the property of Jedi Santari Khri, and is holding a crucial key that unlocks High Republic tech.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>This leads Cal on a quest to locate the mysterious and inaccessible planet Tanalorr, which is hidden within a nebula that destroys any ships that venture within.</p><h2 id=h-reawakening-the-lost-jedi data-injectable=false>Reawakening the lost Jedi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor™_20230419195106.jpg><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>While exploring some mysterious ruins Cal comes across a strange figure floating in a Bacta tank and receives a Force vision of him and Khri as Jedi Knights. Believing that this Jedi could be a vital ally Cal awakens him, only to quickly discover that he’s not exactly on the side of the light.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>This is Dagan Gera, who helped construct a Jedi Temple on Tanalorr during the High Republic, only to find the planet invaded by the Nihil (see the High Republic books and comics), with the Jedi Order ordering him to retreat and abandon the planet.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>Gera refused. Now he has a huge bone to pick with the Jedi and wants to reclaim Tanalorr. After dueling Cal, Gera flees with the aid of his second-in-command Rayvis, an ancient alien who spent centuries imprisoned in a Jedi prison before the Order’s fall released him.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>Needing advice, Cal decides to contact his old Fallen Order friend Cere. She’s joined up Jedi Master Eno Cordovo, Nightsister Merrin, and a cult known as the Anchorites on the moon Jedha (as seen in Rogue One) where they’re preserving what remains of the Jedi Order’s archives.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>Realizing that Tanalorr could be the one place in the galaxy the Empire can’t reach, Cal sets out on a mission to retrieve the lost compasses that chart the way through the nebula.</p><h2 id=h-the-path-to-tanalorr data-injectable=false>The path to Tanalorr</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor™_20230421112135.jpg><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Cal and Bode promptly set out to track these compasses down, taking them to the Shattered Moon base and back to the ruins of Koboh, though neither trip proves fruitful. Along the way, Cal and Merrin defend an ancient temple that’s being attacked by Imperials, with the experience drawing them closer and leading them to kiss.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Cal returns once again to Koboh to discover that ancient droid Zee has been kidnapped (droidnapped?) by Dagon’s sidekick Rayvis, leading to another team-up with Bode as they explore a crashed Trade Federation Lucrehulk packed with battledroids and raiders.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>Their rescue mission succeeds, with Cal and Bode squaring off against Dagan Gera for a second time before escaping with Zee. Though Rayvis seizes the High Republic key.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Pursuing him to the Shattered Moon station, Cal duels with and eventually bests Rayvis, with the ancient warrior choosing to die with honor. Meanwhile, back on Koboh, Dagan Gera has assumed command of a flying fortress and is engaged in a pitched battle against the Empire, who he considers so weak it’s embarrassing the Jedi were ever beaten by them.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false>Cal and Bode team up once more to fight their way to the top of the fortress, where the pair battle one more time with Dagan Gera.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>This time Cal and Bode triumph, with the pair uniting to kill the powerful fallen Jedi and retrieve the last key to Tanalorr. They return to Cere’s Jedi Archive on Jedha and celebrate, with Bode and Cal bonding over a drink as the hunky warrior opens up about the young daughter his rebellious missions prevent him from visiting.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>Cal and Merrin smooch a bit more, everyone sits around a campfire drinking tea, and the future is looking bright. Until…</p><h2 id=h-betrayal data-injectable=false>Betrayal!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor™_20230421202416.jpg><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>At the moment Cere finally makes the decision to officially move the Jedi base to Tanalorr, Bode pulls out a blaster, blows Cordova away, and flees with the key. Bode is a spy!</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>A panicked Cal chases him through the base, then the pair mount speeder bikes and rocket through the desert as AT-ATs close in on the Jedi base. Cal catches up with Bode, only for him to pull out a lightsaber and do battle. Bode is a Jedi!</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Bode easily beats Cal and tosses him off a cliff. Control then switches to Cere as she and the Anchorites defend the base from endless waves of Stormtroopers and AT-ATs. Cere then ushers Cal’s allies into the Mantis and returns to the archive to copy vital data on their hidden network before the Empire finds it. Enter… Darth Vader.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Cere battles Vader amidst the burning Jedi archive, with the Sith Lord one of the most powerful enemies in the game. For a brief moment, it even appears she’s triumphed, though Vader impales her with his lightsaber and kills her.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>Cal comes to and rushes to the archive, finding Cere’s body and vowing vengeance on Bode for betraying them to the Empire.</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>The Mantis crew tracks his craft, which lands at an Imperial ISB base on Nova Garon. A furious Cal fights his way through the base to Bode’s quarters, where he meets his daughter Kata. Bode arrives and the pair have a tense exchange before Bode literally turns the tables on Cal (by throwing a table at him) and escapes through the base. Cal pursues, is faced with countless Stormtroopers, and embraces the Dark Side.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Cal brutally carves his way through the remaining Imperials only to find that Bode has fled to Tanalorr. Imperial Commander Denvik arrives, with a furious Cal force-choking him, only for Merrin to plead with him to return to the light. Cal does, though from now on in combat he can enter a rage-fuelled Dark Side mode.</p><h2 id=h-the-ending data-injectable=false>The ending</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor™_20230424120411.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>With the help of Zee, Cal figures out a risky way to get to Tanalorr, though all very nearly die in the nebula. Cal and Merrin find the ancient Jedi temple and meet Kata, who’s not exactly enthused about spending the rest of her life with her Dad on a spooky deserted planet.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Cal and Merrin are both orphans and don’t want the same fate as Kata, so they and Kata try their best to talk Bode down and convince him to surrender.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>But at this point, there’s no turning back for Bode, and he brutally fights Cal and Merrin with a combination of lightsaber skills, Force powers, and ranged weapons. Cal gets the upper hand and tries one more time to convince his friend to give up, though Bode grabs Cal by the neck and begins Force-choking Merrin.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>Cal escapes, Merrin tosses a knife into Bode, and Bode finally tries to shoot Cal only for his gun to malfunction. Cal then repeatedly shoots Bode with his blaster, killing him.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>The pair then take Kata in as their own and burn Cere, Cordova, and Bode’s bodies on funeral pyres. Cal vows to make Tanalorr a sanctuary for those fleeing the Empire, with Greez already planning a new saloon for the planet.</p><h2 id=h-what-s-next-in-the-star-wars-jedi-series data-injectable=false>What’s next in the Star Wars Jedi series?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor™_20230424120935.jpg><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>A sequel to Jedi: Survivor would inevitably focus on Cal gathering any remaining Jedi, Jedi texts, artifacts, and refugees and keeping them safe on Tanalorr. As the game ends he’s talking about tracking down any remaining Anchorites and bringing them to Tanalorr.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=false>It also seems likely that Kata will play a major role in the next game. This timeline still has nine years before A New Hope, so we could see her as a teenager and, as the daughter of a Jedi, we wouldn’t be at all surprised if she became Cal’s padawan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoqq2ZomLEor7SZqGenJliwLa%2B1aKtqKpdqMGwvthmmKecXZq7pbXNoGSesKChrqq6xJ1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
