Adkins was born in the small Louisiana town of Sarepta in 1962, and he took up guitar lessons at an early age; he went on to study music at Louisiana Tech, where he also played football and worked on an offshore oil rig after graduating.</p><p>His finger was severed in an accident while on the job, and after several years, he returned to music with the gospel quartet the New Commitments. In the early ’90s, he began to pursue a solo career, playing honky tonk bars and clubs as often as he could, and honing a powerful, wide-ranging baritone voice in the process. He then spent several years on the circuit and finally moved to Nashville to try his luck in the industry; he was quickly signed to Capitol by Scott Hendricks, who had produced for the likes of Brooks & Dunn, Faith Hill, and Alan Jackson. Adkins issued his debut album, Dreamin’ Out Loud, in 1996, and it established him as a rising star. The lead single, “Every Light in the House,” went to number three; “I Left Something Turned on at Home” hit number two; and “(This Ain’t) No Thinkin’ Thing” went all the way to number one. His 1997 follow-up album, Big Time, spawned another Top Five hit in “The Rest of Mine,” and “Lonely Won’t Leave Me Alone” just missed the Top Ten.</p><p>Adkins left Capitol and signed with Toby Keith’s Show Dog imprint distributed by Universal. In May of 2010, he debuted his first single for the label, “This Ain’t No Love Song.” The album Cowboy’s Back in Town was released in August of that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fqb%2Bir8RmmJ2jmaPAtHnBoqagqpGltbp5xZqarWWTlr%2BmsdFmmLCZopnAbrrErWSwp6KptW64yJ%2BcZqukpL%2B6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
