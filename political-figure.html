Named Chancellor of the Exchequer just five years later, he earned praise for devising a massive bailout package to support struggling businesses and individuals amid the spread of Covid-19. Sunak fell short in his initial bid for the Conservative Party leadership, but he became the U.K.'s first prime minister of color when Liz Truss abruptly resigned from the post in October 2022.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">How Old Is Rishi Sunak?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rishi Sunak was born on May 12, 1980, in Southampton, England.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Parents and Nationality</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sunak's parents were born to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tatler.com/article/rishi-sunak-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-feature data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Indian-origin families" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Indian-origin families</a> in East Africa before moving to England in the 1960s.

He went on to edit the school newspaper, The Wykehamist, and became Winchester's first "head boy" from an Indian background.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sunak then enrolled at the University of Oxford's Lincoln College, where he studied the Philosophy, Politics and Economics curriculum.
