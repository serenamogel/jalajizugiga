(Ripped from future headlines, obviously.) The ending theatergoers saw involved Salt captured by the CIA and being revealed as a trained-from-childhood Russian sleeper agent, However, she wants nothing to do with them now that she's all grown up, so Peabody, the CIA agent in charge of her, gives her the go-ahead to escape, invade Russia, and go after the other agents there. That's where the film ends, because if they ever want to do a sequel, they need material.</p><p>The extended ending, however, shows there's no need for a sequel; all we need is Angelina Jolie coldly killing everyone for a couple minutes. After an alternate escape scene in which she pretends to swallow cyanide in order to escape a CIA-filled hospital, Salt ventures to Russia, finds the lead agent (Orlov), shoots him, ties him to a rock, and tosses him in the water so he drowns. Then, as we pan away from Salt looking down at the water, we see Orlov's entire facility begin to explode. Salt just blew up the entire place, presumably taking every agent inside, including all the children being trained as spies. There's cold, then there's kill-the-children cold. Interestingly, Salt kills Orlov halfway through the film in the theatrical cut, so this ending had to remove the murder so it could happen later. It's either that or Orlov has Wolverine-like regeneration powers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAkGxqaWeUmrmmwMSdZKanpp6ybrHNnaCnn6Nir6bA056pZqeinrSqusClZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
