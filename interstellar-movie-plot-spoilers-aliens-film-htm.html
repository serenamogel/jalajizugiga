While this seems like a major deviation from what we perceive as the plot, it sounds exciting. From a Latino site named Desde Hollywood:</p><p>"Desde Hollywood just learned through an inside source that their new location, Iceland, has already seen major action:&nbsp;A Spaceship crash!</p><p>Knowing that Nolan doesn't work with a second unit I assume that he directed the sequence created with practical effects. One and that may play an important part in the story.</p><p>I am also told that models for some sort of&nbsp;Drones&nbsp;have also been created.</p><p>Now, are you ready for the most intriguing part of this scoop?</p><p>A bigger aircraft will be featured. Something my source refers to as&nbsp;The Mother Ship."</p><p>The site is quick to warn that these are not exactly spoilers and how they arrived at the conclusion of "The mother ship" is still speculation.</p><p>However, it is not exactly out of left field for Christopher Nolan to have aliens in his movie even though his only involvement with aliens was writing the story for "Man of Steel."</p><p>There is also the possibility that the assumption is inaccurate, and that the so-called "Mother ship" may simply be a larger human ship. Does this indicate a 'migration' of sorts? Did the explorers find another habitable planet and now all the humans are moving?</p><p>Hold that thought and remember that the entire post was about a Spaceship Crash!</p><p>Spoilers or no spoilers, "Interstellar" is one of the most anticipated films of the year-in large part because of Christopher Nolan (his brother co-wrote the script) and eventually the 'stellar' cast that he attracts to his films headed by newly minted Academy Best Actor Matthew McConaughey, Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway.</p><p>All the questions on "Interstellar" will be answered on November 7, 2014. But with the 'Inception' director, the answers only lead to more questions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rLzOqaqtmaKve6S7zGiYq6yZmLmmv45xb2ltZGR%2FcX2TaWtqbV%2Beu7Wx0ayrnqSclr9uuc6voJ5loKG8tXnSqaaipJWnwG6ty6Kcp6tdm7atuY2hq6Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
