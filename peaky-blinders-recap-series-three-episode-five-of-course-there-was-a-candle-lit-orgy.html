Can those who have seen the entire series on Netflix please refrain from discussing the finale until it airs in the UK next week.<br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Welcome back Tommy Shelby. After four weeks of being off his game, we saw him return to peak scheming as it transpired that he’d spent his three-month recuperation period following that nasty head injury dreaming up a plan to combat both the mad Georgian aristocrats and Father Hughes (in addition to having some rather personal morphine-based dreams about poor Mary, whose shocked expression on being told was one of the night’s funniest moments).</p><figure id=10bc972f-4a0d-4c32-a00b-3664173b9452 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Poor shocked Mary, the subject of Tommy’s morphine-addled dreams.</span> Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd/Tiger Aspect</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>So what is the plan? As with everything Tommy comes up with, I’m sure we don’t yet know the half of it. But we do know he’s done a deal with the Soviets to ensure that the guns and tanks planned for the uprising will prove utterly worthless, which in turn negates the need to blow up the train. Meanwhile, operation Take the Georgians For All They’re Worth is in full swing – and Tommy has assembled a tunnelling <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">A Team</a> of first world war veterans to ensure that they pull it off.</p><figure id=fc2e175f-c6ab-47a3-a825-1cceba7f7a93 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Tommy assembles his A Team of tunnellers.</span> Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd/Tiger Aspect</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>And what of the deadly priest – Father O’Paedo, as the members of this blog have so aptly named him? That one’s a little more problematic. It turns out that Michael’s big secret isn’t that he’s planning to bring down the Shelby empire, but that he was abused by Father Hughes as a child and would like revenge. Unfortunately – as is so often the case on this show – what the Shelby men want is in direct contrast to what the women desire. Thus Tommy’s plan to allow Michael his day of vengeance has put him on a collision course with a righteously furious Polly, who ended the episode declaring: “I swear to God if my son pulls the trigger, I will bring this whole fucking organisation down around your ears.” In a season that has been all about family and the need to stay united for victory, I wouldn’t take that threat lightly.</p><h2 id=our-heroes><strong>Our heroes</strong></h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>This was also an episode stuffed full of sex, most of it not desperately happy. Polly and her lovely artist finally came together in a beautifully shot scene – though I do worry that she chose to tell him about having murdered Inspector Campbell. If he is a spy, that’s a huge mistake, and if he isn’t I’m not sure it was quite the turn-on she intended. Meanwhile the Georgians hosted an orgy – because this is Peaky Blinders and quite honestly a candle-lit orgy involving vodka, blow jobs and Cossack soldiers is probably the one thing missing from this series. So John shamelessly enjoyed himself, Arthur got drunk, broke his vows to Linda, and was thoroughly miserable, and Tommy and Tatiana indulged in the Siberian Kiss AKA a spot of light strangulation to induce visions of Grace. Hmm Tommy, you might be doing well on the plotting against your enemies front but I’m still not sure about your grieving process.</p><h2 id=the-bad-guys><strong>The bad guys</strong></h2><figure id=122b6ac2-8e2c-4f35-b1c2-f3816576b09d data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Tom Hardy has a ball as Alfie Solomons, the walking quote machine.</span> Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd/Tiger Aspect</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>The best news of the week was the return of Tom Hardy’s walking quote machine Alfie Solomons, who was called in by Tommy to do a spot of jewellery assessment ahead of the robbery. Hardy, as always, had a complete ball in his scenes. First, speaking truth to Tommy (“You’ve been fucking about with the Russians, you silly boy”), then taunting Arthur over his conversion (“Congratulations Tommy you now have the finished article … that man will murder and maim for you with God on his side”) before riling up the Georgians by revealing that he spoke Russian, wasn’t terribly keen on the aristocracy – “You people hunted my mum with dogs through the snow, but today is about forgiveness innit?” – and knew his stuff about jewels. That particular revelation turned out to be pretty important, not least because it marked the first time we’ve seen the Georgians make a misstep. They underestimated Tommy and presumed they could fob him off with a bunch of fake stones. Now they know they can’t, what will their next move be?</p><h2 id=additional-notes><strong>Additional notes</strong></h2><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> It was a very bad week for Michael, who in addition to revealing his secret about Father Hughes has also managed to knock up the motor heiress. I wouldn’t like to be in his shoes if his mother finds out he’s busy procuring a backstreet abortion for the young lady in question.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Ada officially joined the family business and it’s already clear she’s going to kick some arse. I think Tommy might have underestimated his sister, given her comments to Polly about control.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> I loved Arthur’s “I’m Old Testament” line. Of course you are Arthur, I never doubted that.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> I also related to his repeated requests for vodka at the orgy. If I was shut in the room with a bunch of crazy cossacks, I’d be demanding a drink too.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Or perhaps cossack dancing like John … that’s also possible.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Interesting to see John giving Stefan the pep talk. He does have his moments.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Polly’s sarcastic remarks to Michael about his constant phoning should have struck a chord with mothers of teenagers everywhere.</p><figure id=b903cf69-6928-440d-9cca-63edbd1bb33f data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Johnny Dogs, the only straight-up person on this show.</span> Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd/Tiger Aspect</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Sometimes I think Johnny Dogs might be the only person on this show who isn’t following some sort of secret scheme (and Curly of course).</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Finally, I thought Helen McCrory was outstanding in this episode. She can make you feel Polly’s hurt and desire and desperation with barely a word.</p><h2 id=anachronistic-yet-strangely-right-song-of-the-week><strong>Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week</strong></h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>A strong week for music, including a brief snippet of an as-yet-unreleased Leonard Cohen song when Tatiana and Tommy had sex. But this can only go to the episode’s opening sequence, which used <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">David Bowie’s Lazarus</a> to mesmerising and hallucinatory effect.</p><h2 id=quote-of-the-week><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2><p class=dcr-epamsi>“I’m guessing that all the bad ideas round here are you – that’s right innit?” Mr Alfie Solomons, ladies and gentlemen, self-proclaimed wandering Jew, windup merchant supreme and astute judge of character.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>So what did you think? Has Tommy rediscovered his mojo? Or will the conflict with Polly bring the whole thing crashing down? Can Ada change the company and will the Shelby brothers actually allow Arthur to leave? And given that bad luck comes in threes, what can we expect Michael to learn next week? As ever, all speculation and no spoilers welcome below …</p><figure id=227ce4e7-aac7-4782-8707-6a82e54033ab data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-4i301w>Quick Guide</span><h4 class=dcr-z3cfvy>Peaky Blinders: all our episode-by-episode recaps</h4><span class=dcr-55zfp0><span class=dcr-198xk8z><span class=dcr-41evle></span>Show</span></span><p><strong>Series 5</strong></p><p><a href=#>Episode 1: Black Tuesday</a><br><a href=#>Episode 2: Black Cats</a></p><p><strong>Series 4</strong></p><p><a href=#>Episode 1: The Noose</a><br><a href=#>Episode 2: Heathens</a><br><a href=#>Episode 3: Blackbird</a><br><a href=#>Episode 4: Dangerous</a><br><a href=#>Episode 5: The Duel</a><br><a href=#>Episode 6: The Company</a></p><p><strong>Series 3</strong></p><p><a href=#>Episode 1</a><br><a href=#>Episode 2</a><br><a href=#>Episode 3</a><br><a href=#>Episode 4</a><br><a href=#>Episode 5</a><br><a href=#>Episode 6</a></p><p><strong>Series 2</strong></p><p><a href=#>Episode 1</a><br><a href=#>Episode 2</a><br><a href=#>Episode 3</a><br><a href=#>Episode 4</a><br><a href=#>Episode 5</a><br><a href=#>Episode 6</a></p><p><strong>Series 1</strong></p><p><a href=#>Episode 1</a><br><a href=#>Episode 2</a><br><a href=#>Episode 3</a><br><a href=#>Episode 4</a><br><a href=#>Episode 5</a><br><a href=#>Episode 6</a></p>Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.</figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKymYq6vsIyrmJ2hn2R%2FcX2VaKGupl9lf3C8xJqismWSobavsMSrqmaqlZiusXnSnqminaNiwam%2BxJ5knqiZqLylsYyfoK%2BdXaSzbq%2FOrqmsnV2ptaa%2BxGaumqtdlnqkrc2do55lnJ7BbrvRoLA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
