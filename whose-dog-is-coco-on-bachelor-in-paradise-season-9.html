When an adorably small dog becomes the drawcard of a television series, fans can‚Äôt help but oblige.

On a clip of the dog posted to Instagram, Jess ‚Äî who was eliminated on the spot after confronting Zach ‚Äî said she misses Coco, while first-week eliminee Olivia Lewis said the dog ‚Äúis always up to no good.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bachelor-In-Paradise-6.png><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=false>Coco becoming a fan-favorite is no small feat for a season of Bachelor In Paradise that has featured <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift superfans</a>, a love triangle between Rachel, Brayden, and Sean, and one contestant‚Äôs head-scratching inability to poop.
