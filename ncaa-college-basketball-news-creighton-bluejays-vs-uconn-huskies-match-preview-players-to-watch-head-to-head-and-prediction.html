Sokol Arena. While the Creighton Bluejays have a 10-2 tally and occupy the third spot in the Big East, the UConn Huskies are going strong with a 10-3 stat.</span></p><p><span>This is going to be one of the most anticipated clashes of the Big East.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Players to watch</strong></h2><p><span>The Bluejays have found a reliable player in their forward Emma Ronsiek. Ronsiek stands at the top of the points average tally for the Creighton with 18.6 points per game. If Ronsiek continues to baffle her opponents in this game as she has done in the past, then the Huskies will have a difficult time recovering.</span></p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Paige-Bueckers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span>The other player that the Bluejays will depend on is their guard Lauren Jensen. Jensen has besotted an average of 17 points per game with 4.2 rebounds per match. She forms a destructible force with Ronsiek, and if the UConn want to make the most of this game, then they will have to contain her. Else the game can slip away from the Huskies’ hands.</span></p><p><span>For the Huskies, their star player <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Paige Bueckers has delivered on time</a>. Despite battling injuries, the Huskies are going strong in the tourney and Bueckers has smoked 19.2 points per match. If Bueckers continues her on-song performance then there is no stopping the Huskies.</span></p><p><span>The other star player for the Huskies this season has been Aaliyah Edwards. Edwards has stepped up to fill the role of a second fiddle. She has been dominant both in her offense and defense. In the backcourt she has been a wall to penetrate nabbing 8.5 rebounds per contest.</span></p><p><span>The Bluejays will have to take care of both the team’s performers else they might not win this much anticipated clash.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Head to Head</strong></h2><p><span>As </span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>per</span></a><span> the Register Citizen, the UConn have a clean 7-0 record against the Bluejays, and the closest the latter have ever come was when the Huskies edged past the Creighton by a 62-60 margin in last year February.</span></p><p><span>The game is going to be an eye-grabbing one since both the teams are good performers in the Big East and are also ranked in the top 25 in AP Polls.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Prediction</strong></h2><p><span>The Huskies might be able to continue with their clean record with the Creighton, albeit it will be a close match. If the Creighton are able to turn the tides, then this will be one of the most memorable games of the Big East.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Paige-Bueckers.jpg><p><span>The game might not have high scores since both the teams have formidable defenses, and if the Huskies are to win this then they will have to continue their collaborative team performance in this one. Overall, a nail-biting game is guaranteed.</span></p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Sending Shockwaves in The Basketball World, Know 18YO MiLaysia Fulwiley’s Story</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82cmJplk6S5rbHGnmSbmaOgsrWuwKWjZqaVrMBur9GeoKCgpKS7bq7Lrpyjmamoere%2FjK6aqKaeYrW2v8qinKxlnZbBpLSMqamerpmaxG68y5qwnqqjYsGwedaaq5ygXZ2yorCMraZmoJWWsW6tzZ1kqaqVmbakwMiopWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
