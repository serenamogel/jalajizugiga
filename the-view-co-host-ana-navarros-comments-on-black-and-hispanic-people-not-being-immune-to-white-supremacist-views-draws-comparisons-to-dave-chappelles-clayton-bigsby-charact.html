While the investigation is still in its early stages, officials are checking if Garcia was motivated by white supremacist or neo-Nazi beliefs.</p><p>Co-host Sunny Hostin responded to Navarro, remarking that while the shooter‚Äôs ethnicity is ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù in this case, he also identified as white.</p><p>‚ÄúBut this shooter who happened to be Hispanic and Latino, which is bizarre to me, had a white supremacy moniker on him,‚Äù Hostin said. ‚ÄúSo [FBI Director] Christopher Wray, these are not my words, so people don‚Äôt start with the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a race baiter crap.‚Äô Christopher Wray said that the biggest threat to our democracy is white supremacy and domestic terrorism. He testified before Congress,‚Äù Hostin said.</p><p>In response to Navarro‚Äôs comments, one user on Twitter posted a meme of Dave Chappelle from his well-known Clayton Bigsby skit on the ‚ÄúDave Chappelle Show,‚Äù where the comedian plays an old, blind Black man living in an all-white, backwoods community who claims to be white and dislikes minorities. The skit is a parody that speaks to some Black Americans who showcase an inability to own their identities as Black people and assimilate into white culture as a result.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=und dir=ltr>Clayton Bigsby‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Fz3Fwb1acB</a></p>‚Äî doranchavez (@doranchavez) <a href=#>May 9, 2023</a></figure><p>As for other reactions, some people support Navarro‚Äôs viewpoint, saying it‚Äôs possible for people of color to own white supremacist views. Others said she missed the mark entirely, with some claiming the Proud Boys aren‚Äôt a white supremacist group but instead are a nationalist organization that values constitutional rights in America.</p><p>According to the Anti-Defamation League, some members of the Proud Boys ‚Äúespouse white supremacist and antisemitic ideologies and/or engage with white supremacist groups.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You think it's possible for a black person to be a white supremacist. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p><p>Did you miss the word white in the description?</p><p>Can't believe you have a job on TV.</p>‚Äî Melanie (@Imagecaptured) <a href=#>May 8, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Let me help ya'll out here.
