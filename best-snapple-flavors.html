We went on a Snapple-snatching spree and curated a top ten list of best Snapple flavors. Cue the snaps.</p><p>Core memory alert: Do you remember “Snapple Facts”? You know, the random fun fact printed under every bottle cap of Snapple? It’s always something in the vein of, “Termites eat through wood two times faster when listening to rock music.” No, I did not make that up. That’s a real Snapple fact. There’s around 1,500 Snapple facts in total, and yes, you can still find them under bottle caps today. If that’s not the kind of brilliant marketing to keep a brand running for forty-plus years, I don’t know what it is.&nbsp;</p><p>Fair warning: I am, <a href=#>once again</a>, coming down from a severe sugar high after this taste test. While I’m grateful that Snapple doesn’t use corn syrup in their drinks, the sugar content here is no laughing matter. So unlike Snapple, I’m not going to sugarcoat my reviews. (Har har. She’s a comedian, folks.) In an effort to balance out my Debbie Downer persona with something fun and exciting, I’m also going to rank some of my favorite Snapple facts! Yay! So without further ado, here are the best Snapple flavors to snap up.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e3772f></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="#10 Best Snapple Flavor" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BEST_SNAPPLE_FLAVORS_INSET_10.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Snapple!</p><strong>Snapple Tea Half n’ Half Lemonade Iced Tea</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>If you like sugary <a href=#>Arnold Palmers</a>, you might jive with this. To be clear, this is not the best Snapple flavor for Arnold Palmer purists—this tastes like someone poured a cup of sugar into Lipton iced tea lemonade and called it a day. Luckily, this <a href=#>half & half lemonade-iced tea</a> has a pleasantly sour, tart quality that complements the sweetness.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yeah, and here’s your Snapple fun fact: “Lizards communicate by doing push-ups.” So the gym bros of the reptile kingdom?

Originally released in 1999 and discontinued six years later, Snapple Elements was a line of lower sugar Snapple flavors based on the “natural elements.” (Earth, air, fire… very Avatar the Last Airbender.) These reappeared in stores in 2022. I can’t tell you how different they are from the first run, but I can say that overall, I enjoyed the muted, mellow taste of Snapple Rain. Even the soothing cool blue color of the bottle convinced me that every sip would be light and refreshing, like a sunshower in the summer. And while it doesn’t quite achieve that (it’s still too sweet, sorry), the vibes are really close. The official flavor is “agave cactus,” but it’s basically tart, sweet, watered-down pear juice. Still, if you’re anything like me and possess taste buds easily swayed by aesthetics, this is the best Snapple flavor for you.</p><p>Snapple fun fact: “Mangoes can get sunburned.” Hmm.

Is it too sweet? You bet! But the acidity from the lemons is pleasantly zingy. Of the Snapple lemonades (like watermelon and black cherry), Pink Lemonade was the best Snapple flavor I tried.&nbsp;</p><p>Snapple fun fact: “Mountain lions can whistle.”&nbsp;</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e37d2e></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="#7 Best Snapple Flavor" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BEST_SNAPPLE_FLAVORS_INSET_08.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Snapple!</p><strong><strong><strong>&nbsp;Snapple Tea Lemon Tea</strong></strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>The best Snapple flavors are the ones that keep things simple. Case in point: Snapple Lemon Tea. This is basically a glass of brisk ice tea with a spritz of lemon… plus a few dozen sugar cubes. But you know what? The lemon’s acidity actually balances out the signature Snapple sweetness pretty nicely. I would happily sip this at a garden party.&nbsp;</p><p>Snapple fun fact: “A flipped coin is more likely to land on the side it started on.” That’s a trick I will be shamelessly using in the future.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e56f38></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="#6 Best Snapple Flavor" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BEST_SNAPPLE_FLAVORS_INSET_06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Snapple!</p><strong><strong>Snapple Elements Fire</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>No, Snapple’s “fire” element is not a spicy fruit juice. The intended flavor is, cleverly enough, dragon fruit. (Get it? Because dragons breathe fire?) Now, are these drinks actually made from real dragon fruit? Of course not. It’s mostly just pear and grape concentrate, but hey, close enough. This vibrant Snapple drink is super tangy, a little bitter, and not nearly as sweet as the others, which I appreciate. All the Snapple flavors market themselves as “refreshing,” but this one actually is refreshing. Which is kind of funny, considering “fire” and “refreshing” are diametrically opposed concepts. But I digress. This is the best Snapple flavor from their Elements line, hands down!</p><p>Snapple fun fact: “The longest attack of hiccups lasted 68 years.”</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e47a44></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="#5 Best Snapple Flavor" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BEST_SNAPPLE_FLAVORS_INSET_05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Snapple!</p><strong>Snapple Tea Zero Sugar Raspberry Tea </strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>If you’ve been waiting with bated breath for me to bring a zero sugar Snapple into this list, well, don’t suffocate. We’re finally here. And let me just say: I know I’ve griped about the sugar and sweetness levels in the normal Snapple flavors. Yes, their line of zero sugar flavors is definitely a reprieve from that. Their zero sugar Raspberry Tea is particularly pleasant—it has a bitter, earthy appeal. My one complaint? You can’t escape the artificial sweetener aftertaste. If you’re sensitive to that, I would honestly skip the zero sugar Snapple drinks and go straight for the real stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Snapple fun fact: “A caterpillar has more muscles than a human.” Someone tag Hank Green for this one, please.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e3752d></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="#4 Best Snapple Flavor" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BEST_SNAPPLE_FLAVORS_INSET_03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Snapple!</p><strong><strong>Peach Tea</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Snapple’s Peach Tea tastes like it was made by a sweet-as-pie Southern grandma who tipped just a little too much cane sugar into the mix. The peach itself is nice and mellow. The juice tastes less tangy than the other Snapple flavors, which I like—but good golly, Miss Molly, it’s still an instant sugar high. While I firmly believe this is one of the best Snapple flavors, I still think someone needs to call up the Snapple HQ and remind them that they don’t need to add that much sugar. They can dial it back a bit!&nbsp;</p><p>Snapple fun fact: “A bolt of lightning can reach temperatures hotter than the sun.”</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e57d40></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="#3 Best Snapple Flavor" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BEST_SNAPPLE_FLAVORS_INSET_04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Snapple!</p><strong>Snapple Tea Zero Sugar Peach Tea </strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Snapple’s zero sugar peach tea tastes like it was made by a sweet-as-pie Southern grandma who, hearing my previous complaint loud and clear, swapped the cane sugar for Stevia.
