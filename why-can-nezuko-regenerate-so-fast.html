Moreover, Nezuko has never shown any signs of undernourishment as she is always ready to assist her brother with her overwhelming strength and deadly Blood Demon Art.<h2>Why does Nezuko sleep so much?</h2>Nezuko doesn't eat people; Tanjiro won't let her. He doesn't want her to become fully demon, and she obviously doesn't want to hurt anyone. So, in order to compensate for the lack of "nutrients," Nezuko is constantly sleeping. This also causes her to regenerate much slower than a normal demon.<h2>Is Tanjiro Hashira level?</h2>Tanjiro did not become a Hashira towards the end of the series but defeating Muzan is enough reason to say that he is Hashira level.

In this state, referred to as her Berserker Form, she easily overpowered Daki, who holds the rank of Upper-Moon Six (a title she shares with her brother).<h2>Is Nezuko a hybrid?</h2>'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba' chapter 195 reveals why Muzan dreaded Yoriichi, Nezuko turns into human-demon hybrid?
