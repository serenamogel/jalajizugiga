Use of ground barriers (mulch, fabrics) can reduce pupation and fly emergence.<h2>What does the cherry fruit fly look like?</h2>Both black and western cherry fruit flies have black bodies with tinges of yellow on the head and striped margins on the thorax. Adults have a creamy white dot near the centre of the back. The wings are marked with blackish bands.
